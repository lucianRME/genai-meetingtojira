00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Alice: Let's align on the password reset feature for the customer portal.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Bob: Right now users can only reset via support tickets, which delays resolution.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Carol: We want them to reset using an email one-time code, correct?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Alice: Yes, and the code should expire in 10 minutes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Bob: Should we add two-factor authentication during reset, or only at login?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Carol: For now, just at login. Reset can be OTP-only.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Alice: We'll need acceptance criteria: successful OTP, expired OTP, and invalid OTP.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Bob: Also handle rate limiting â€” max 3 attempts per hour per user.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Carol: QA will need positive and negative test cases around OTP verification.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Alice: And regression tests to ensure existing login flow still works.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Bob: We'll also need to send an audit event when password is successfully reset.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Carol: Good, that will help us verify in the logs.
